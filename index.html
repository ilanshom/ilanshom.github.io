  <h1>Research Projects</h1>
  
  <div id="cite"><strong>Fundamentals of Multi-hop Multi-flow Wireless Networks </strong> &nbsp; <a href="#j1">[J1]</a>,<a href="#c1">[C1]</a>,<a href="#j6">[J6]</a>,<a href="#c5">[C5]</a>,<a href="#c6">[C6]</a>
  
  <p>Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the wireless data traffic, caused by the success of online media streaming services and the proliferation of
  smart phones, tablets, and netbooks. Given the scarcity of wireless spectrum, the only way to meet this ever-increasing demand is to exploit a much denser spatial
  reuse of the spectrum by considering new wireless network architectures; in particular those based on <i>multi-hop</i> and <i>multi-flow</i> paradigms.
  However, little is known about the fundamental principles that govern the design of communication schemes for multi-hop multi-flow systems, and, in most of these scenarios,
  an exact characterization of the Shannon capacity is still out of the question. Thus, in this research project, we seek alternative ways to study these networks, such as
  (i) formulating and studying deterministic models that mimic the behavior of their stochastic counterparts, and
  (ii) considering the high-SNR capacity approximation provided by a <i>degrees of freedom</i> analysis. </p>

  <p>The characterization of the degrees of freedom often leads to a conceptual understanding of fundamental aspects of communication in these networks.
  This is the case, for instance, of our results in <a href="#j6">[J6]</a>. By showing that
  <font face="times"> <i>K</i></font> degrees of freedom can be achieved on a two-hop
  <font face="times"> <i>K</i> x <i>K</i> x <i>K</i> </font> network,
  we provide an answer to a conceptual question about distributed MIMO systems which can be formulated in an algebraic way as a diagonalization problem, illustrated below.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="mimo2.png" width=600px></div>
  <p>If the <font face="times"> <i>K</i></font> relays could cooperate (i.e., if they were a single MIMO node), they would apply the linear transformation <img src="eqinv.png" height=18px> 
  in order to diagoanalize the end-to-end network transform. But if the <font face="times"> <i>K</i></font> relays cannot cooperate, how can this end-to-end diagonalization be obtained
  in a distributed way? </p></div>

  <div id="cite"><strong>Robustness of Theoretical Models</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#j2">[J2]</a>,<a href="#c3">[C3]</a>,<a href="#c4">[C4]</a>,<a href="#c5">[C5]</a>,<a href="#j4">[J4]</a>,<a href="#c7">[C7]</a>
  
  <p>Gaussian models are ubiquitous in data compression and data communication problems. The additive noise experienced by wireless receivers,
  for instance, is often modeled as a white Gaussian random process. Similarly, but perhaps less intuitively, data sources are also commonly modeled
  as Gaussian processes. While these models are formally justified in point-to-point setups as the worst-case assumptions, the same was not known to be
  the case in network setups, and the main reason for these assumptions was analytical tractability. Thus, from a theoretical standpoint, a relevant question is:
  In what scenarios are these Gaussian models worst-case assumptions? And, from a practical perspective: Can compression and communication schemes be designed
  under Gaussian assumptions and still be useful in non-Gaussian scenarios? </p>

  <p>We answered these questions in the context of data communication in wireless networks <a href="#j2">[J2]</a> and joint source-channel
  coding in arbitrary networks <a href="#j5">[J5]</a>.
  We proved that the Gaussian distribution is indeed worst-case in these cases, by providing a framework that allows coding schemes designed under Gaussian
  assumptions to be converted to coding schemes that are robust in the sense that they achieve the same performance under arbitrary statistical assumptions.
  The figure below illustrates how this is done in network compression problems <a href="#j5">[J5]</a>.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="gaussian.png" width=600px></p>
  <p>Each source node applies a transformation to its non-Gaussian data source with the purpose of "gaussifying" it. More precisely, we find a sequence of such
  transformations such that the resulting effective sources converge in distribution to Gaussian, i.e.,</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="eqconv1.png" height=27px></p>
  <p>All network nodes will then operate as if the sources were indeed Gaussian, and the destinations will apply the inverse transformations to the reconstructed
  sequences, to "ungaussify" them.
  We show that there exist optimal coding schemes for this network for which the above convergence in distribution implies convergence in distortion, i.e.,</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="eqconv2.png" height=35px></p>
  <p>Besides settling the aforementioned questions, this result and the result in <a href="#j2">[J2]</a> allow us to establish connections between the distortion (or capacity) regions of networks under
  different models. In <a href="#c5">[C5]</a>, we pursued this direction and demonstrated that in two-hop multi-flow wireless networks the capacity under the Gaussian model can be upper
  bounded by the capacity of the network under a deterministic model.</p></div>

  <div id="cite"><strong>Relay Networks with Real-World Constraints</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#j3">[J3]</a>,<a href="#c2">[C2]</a>,
  <a href="#j5">[J5]</a>,<a href="#c8">[C8]</a>
  
  <p>The study of wireless systems is traditionally performed with simplified models whose goal is to capture the fundamental aspects of communication and
  provide insights into the design of optimal communication strategies. However, particularly for the case of large wireless relay networks, there are big
  discrepancies between these theoretical models and the practical systems, which makes the conversion from theory to practice a research effort in itself.
  Examples of these discrepancies include full duplex versus half duplex antennas, and the assumption of availability of channel state information at the network nodes.</p>

  <p>The issues of synchronization between network nodes and energy-efficient communication were addressed in <a href="#j3">[J3]</a> in the context of a two-relay network.
  The main motivation for this work are wireless sensor networks, where nodes operate on batteries and the communication of data tends to be bursty, i.e., intermittent.
  In this scenario, synchronization techniques must be used before every data transmission, and the synchronization energy costs become relevant.
  In <a href="#j3">[J3]</a>, by approximately characterizing the minimum energy-per-bit required in this asynchronous scenario, we were able to prove
  the near optimality of training   sequences for synchronization, and determine, for a given two-node network, what is the optimal relay selection, as illustrated below.</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="beta1.png" height=230px style="padding-right: 100px;"><img src="beta2.png" height=230px></div>
  <p>In the figures above, if relay R2 were in a green area, the optimal relay selection (from an energy point of view) would be R1 and R2, if it were in a red area, the optimal relay selection
  would be only R1, and if it were in a blue area, the optimal relay selection would be only R2. The yellow regions correspond to points where our characterization is not
  tight enough to determine the optimal relay selection.</p>

  <p>This research project comprises many of our ongoing and future research directions. In particular, we have been studying how results on degrees of freedom such as
  <a href="#j1">[J1]</a> and <a href="#j6">[J6]</a> are affected by real-world constraints such as computational complexity and limited
  channel diversity. For example, the recent work in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0898">[Issa]</a> tackles these two issues by characterizing the degrees of freedom achievable
  on a 2 x 2 x 2 wireless network with linear schemes and no channel diversity. We are currently studying how these ideas can be scaled for the general <font face="times"> <i>K</i> x <i>K</i> x <i>K</i> </font> setting.</p>
